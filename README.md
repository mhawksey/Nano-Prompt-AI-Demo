# **Showcase: Gemini Nano Prompt API in a Google Workspace Add-on**

This repository demonstrates the capabilities of the experimental **Chrome Gemini Nano Prompt API** (`LanguageModel`) through a Google Workspace Editor add-on. The add-on allows users to generate and edit diagrams using natural language, primarily serving as an example to explore and showcase the on-device AI potential of Gemini Nano within Chrome extensions.

**The diagram generation feature was chosen specifically to test the capabilities of Gemini Nano in processing text-to-markdown tasks (MermaidJS).**

## **üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies in this Demonstrator**

* **Chrome Gemini Nano Prompt API (`LanguageModel`):** The core AI engine, running on-device in Chrome.  
* **Google Apps Script:** Provides the add-on framework, UI elements (sidebar, menus), and server-side functions for image insertion.  
* **MermaidJS:** Renders text-based diagram definitions into visual diagrams.  
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For the add-on's sidebar user interface and client-side logic.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure**

* `Code.gs`: Server-side Apps Script logic (menu creation, sidebar display, image insertion).  
* `Sidebar.html`: HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript for the add-on's UI and Prompt API interaction.  
* `appsscript.json`: The add-on manifest file.  
* `README.md`: This file.  
* `LICENSE`: Apache 2.0 License.

## **üöÄ Getting Started / Setup (for this Demo Add-on)**

This project is a demonstration Google Workspace Editor add-on.

### **1\. Environment Setup**

* **Google Chrome:** Ensure you are using a recent version of Google Chrome that supports the `LanguageModel` API (preferably Chrome 138 or newer).  
* **Enable Experimental Flags & Download Model:**  
  1. Open `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` in Chrome, select 'Enabled', and relaunch.  
  2. Open `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model`, select 'Enabled BypassPrefRequirement', and relaunch Chrome.  
  3. After relaunching, the on-device model needs to be downloaded.  
     * You can try to trigger the download by navigating to `chrome://components`, finding "Optimization Guide On Device Model" (if listed), and clicking "Check for update".  
     * **If the above doesn't work or the component isn't visible:** Open Chrome DevTools (right-click \> Inspect \> Console) and run the following JavaScript. This actively tries to initialize the model and will show download progress in the console:  
       ```javascript
         const session = await LanguageModel.create({
           monitor(m) {
             m.addEventListener("downloadprogress", (e) => {
               console.log(`Downloaded ${e.loaded} of ${e.total} bytes.`);
             });
           },
         });
       ```
     * Wait for the console to indicate the download is complete or the model is ready.

### **2\. Apps Script Project Setup**

You have two main options to set up the Apps Script project:

**Option 1: Using the Shared Google Doc (Recommended for quick testing in Google Docs)**

1.  **Make a copy** of the shared Google Doc project: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jq3whU6i3XYbm3uipvQ0QWZ5BGmMiP6G903T4rinfF8/copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jq3whU6i3XYbm3uipvQ0QWZ5BGmMiP6G903T4rinfF8/copy)
    *   When you open this link, you'll be prompted to "Make a copy." Click the "Make a copy" button.
    *   This copied Google Document now contains the Apps Script project and is ready for you to use. You can find the script by opening the document and going to `Extensions > Apps Script`.

**Option 2: Manual Setup (For more control or if you prefer not to use the Google Doc method)**

1.  Create a new Google Apps Script project (e.g., by visiting [script.google.com/create](https://script.google.com/create)).
2.  Copy the content of `Code.gs`, `Sidebar.html`, and `appsscript.json` from this repository into the corresponding files in your newly created Apps Script project. Ensure the filenames match exactly.

### **3\. Testing the Add-on**

You have a couple of ways to test the add-on:

**Method 1: Quick Testing in Google Docs (If you used Option 1 for Apps Script Setup)**

If you made a copy of the Google Doc as described in "Apps Script Project Setup - Option 1":

1.  Open your copied Google Document.
2.  Go to `Extensions > Apps Script` to open the script editor.
3.  In the script editor, ensure the `onInstall` function is selected in the function dropdown, and click **Run**. You might be prompted to grant permissions the first time.
4.  Close the script editor and return to your Google Document.
5.  The add-on menu should now be available. Look for an "Extensions" menu item similar to "Nano Prompt AI Demo" (the exact name is defined in `Code.gs`) and select "‚ú® Generate a diagram" (or the relevant menu item to open the sidebar).

This method allows you to quickly test the add-on's functionality directly within Google Docs.

**Method 2: Using Test Deployments (For testing in Google Sheets, Slides, or for more comprehensive testing)**

Follow these steps to test the add-on using a test deployment. This method is required if you want to test the add-on in Google Sheets or Google Slides, or if you used "Apps Script Project Setup - Option 2".

#### *Create a test deployment* 

A test deployment is the combination of an add-on and a test document. Once you have a script version developed and would like to test it as an add-on, follow these steps:

1. If you don‚Äôt have one already, create a spreadsheet, document, presentation, or form to test the add-on with.  
2. Open the script project containing your add-on.  
3. Click **Deploy** \> **Test deployments**.  
4. Next to **Select type**, click Enable deployment types and select **Editor add-on**.  
5. Click **Create new test** or **Add test**.  
6. Choose a code version or select **Latest Code**.  
7. In the **Config** section, select the initial authorization state for the test.  
8. Under **Test document**, click **No document selected**. Select the Sheets, Docs, Slides, or Forms file you want to use to test the add-on and click **Insert**.  
9. Click **Save test**.

All saved test deployments appear in the **Test deployments** dialog. This lets you revisit the same test deployment later on.

#### *Run a test deployment* 

If you have one or more saved test deployments, you can run one of them by following these steps:

1. Open the script project containing your add-on.  
2. Click **Deploy** \> **Test deployments**.  
3. Under **Saved Tests**, select the radio button next to the saved test deployment you want to run and click **Execute**.

The test document opens in a new tab. The add-on is in the authorization state specified in the test deployment. You can verify that the add-on functions as intended by interacting with its menu and UI elements.

> The test document has a URL that you can share with editors of the original test document. This way, you can more easily collaborate with others while testing and developing.  

## **üìñ How to Use (the Demo Add-on after Setup & Testing)**

1. **Open the Add-on:** Once the add-on is running in your test document (as per the testing steps above), find the add-on menu (e.g., "Gemini Diagram Showcase" or the name defined in your `Code.gs`) and select the option to show the sidebar.  
2. **Check AI Model Status:** The sidebar will indicate the Gemini Nano model's status (e.g., "AI is ready," "AI model is downloading...", "Built-in AI (LanguageModel API) is not available..."). If downloading, please wait for it to complete.  
3. **Generate/Edit/Fix Diagram:** Use the input fields and buttons in the sidebar to describe, generate, edit, or fix MermaidJS diagrams.  
4. **Insert Diagram:** Click "Insert Diagram into Document" to place the diagram as an image into your active Google Workspace file.
